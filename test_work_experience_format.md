## Key Improvements:

1. ✅ **Separate bullet points** - Each responsibility on its own line
2. ✅ **Circle bullets (•)** - Professional formatting
3. ✅ **Detailed descriptions** - 2-4 sentences per bullet point explaining what, how, why, and impact
4. ✅ **Technologies separate** - Listed at the end, not mixed with responsibilities
5. ✅ **Better readability** - Clear, organized structure
6. ✅ **More professional** - Comprehensive explanations with context

## What Changed in the Code:

### 1. Updated `backend/services/llm_service.py`
- Added explicit instructions to create separate bullet points
- Added examples of correct vs. wrong formatting
- Clarified that Technologies should only contain tools/software, not responsibilities

### 2. Updated `backend/main.py`
- Updated extraction prompt with same formatting rules
- Added visual examples to guide the AI
- Ensured consistency across all endpoints
